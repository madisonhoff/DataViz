## Hi I'm Madison Hoff!
I'm currently a sophomore at [**Lehigh University**] (http://www1.lehigh.edu/). I'm studying journalism and computer science. I have some experience in HTML and Java. In journalism, I enjoy writing lifestyle articles because everyone has a story! I enjoy meeting new people and learning about new things through my interviews.

I am using GitHub for my *Data Visualization class*, a new class where we are learning the importance of data in journalism. We are learning how to make stories with data and how sometimes it is better to get a message across through a visual of the data as oppose to words since it can become confusing or not as beneficial to get a message across as a visual could.
