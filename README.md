# DataViz
I am Madison Hoff, a sophomore at [**Lehigh University**] (http://www1.lehigh.edu/). I'm studying journalism and computer science. I have some experience in HTML and Java. In journalism, I enjoy writing lifestyle articles because everyone has a story!

I am using GitHub for my Data Visualization class, a new class where we are learning the importance of data and visuals in journalism.
